## Teach AI To Play Snake! Reinforcement Learning With PyTorch and Pygame

In this Python Reinforcement Learning Tutorial series we teach an AI to play Snake! We build everything from scratch using Pygame and PyTorch. The tutorial consists of 4 parts:

- Part 1: Project overview and basics about Reinforcement Learning and Deep Q Learning.  
- Part 2: Environment setup and Snake game implementation.  
- Part 3: Implementing the agent that controls the game.  
- Part 4: Implementing the neural network to predict moves and training it.
